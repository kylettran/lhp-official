            ABOUT LION HEART PRODUCTIONS
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-white/90">
            Lion Heart Productions is an artist-led event and creative production company built on vision, execution, and culture.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-white/80">
            Founded by Aye.Are &amp; Kat Lion Heart Productions began as a platform to create unforgettable live experiences — not just events. What started with intimate gatherings of 20 people quickly evolved into sold-out productions hosting over 150 attendees, proving that intention and quality always scale.

            From high-energy ragers to emotionally driven themed nights like Lovers &amp; Loners, every Lion Heart event is designed with purpose — blending music, visuals, and atmosphere into a premium experience.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-white/80">
